%%% function to take results and graph them
% graph the two signals

% graph the whole timeVsAcceleration, scatter plot where tOpt/2 is for
% nascV1, adjust t per reading.


%graph the whole window, scatter plot where tOpt/2 is for nascV2 (try all
%ts on all windows)

%graph the second window, with the initial topt 
% show that it works as couting a step
%graph the slow walkijn seciont (the one where it has to adjust)
% graph what would have happened if had kept topt there
%plot nasc overtime (on top of graph) , show how it fluctuates.

%graph the whole tVA, scatter plot for nascV4 (single topt)
%maybe run find peaks?
